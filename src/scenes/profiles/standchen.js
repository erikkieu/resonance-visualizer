/**
 * Scene 2 profile: Schubert / Liszt, "Ständchen" (solo piano, ~6:05),
 * performed by the aurora.
 *
 * A lyrical single melody over a rolling accompaniment, D minor turning to
 * D major, a near-silent opening, swells around 1:08 and 3:01, one big
 * climax (~4:32-4:56, peak ~4:52), a smaller swell (~5:13) and a long fade
 * from ~5:27. (This profile was first written for the Andante Festivo on
 * this scene; the user swapped the visuals of scenes 2 and 3.) How the
 * aurora performs it:
 *   - `build` (the score's anticipating drive, smoothed nobly) grows the
 *     curtains in height, width, coverage and brightness
 *   - quiet passages: low, narrow curtains with slow, wide ripples
 *   - sections set the state; the climax flares the curtains (taller,
 *     brighter, the green body warming toward gold, a pink-white crown)
 *   - accented piano attacks send a soft shimmer through the rays and a
 *     gentle colour surge, never on every note
 *
 * Every constant is here; the ones in TUNE are live sliders (T).
